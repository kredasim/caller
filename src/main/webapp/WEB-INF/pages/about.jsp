Small app developed for demonstration purposes as the part of an application for the
internship at Twillio.
</br>
Application is capable of handling user login/registration, activating each user account and
giving calls to specified number. To use the app you need to fill in all of the fields contained
in registration form, and afterwards login with your valid credentials. After loging you need to press "Send activation code"
button to receive your activation code, which will be delivered to the number you have entered
during registration. Then activate your profile and you can try "Call" feature!
</br></br>
Note: as this application is using only trial account of Twillio services it can give calls only to the
numbers that are verified on it's twillio account(therefor it won't probably work for you :-) ).
